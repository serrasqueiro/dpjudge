		<b>What is Payola Diplomacy anyway?</b><br>
	Basically, Payola Diplomacy is a standard game of Diplomacy (on any
	game map, etc.) in which each player has a treasury of "silver pieces"
	that he uses to offer "bribes" to each of the various pieces on the
	board (other players' units but also his own).  Each player must pay
	his own armies and fleets enough to get them to follow the orders he
	wishes them to follow, or risk them doing the bidding of another player.
	The units' only motives in deciding which order to follow, from among
	those that the players suggest, are purely financial.  Think of it as
	having all of the armies and fleets on the game-board led by 
	money-hungry generals and admirals, whose loyalty to
	their various political leaders goes out the window the minute
	a better monetary offer comes along.

<P><b>Okay, but what is the game of Diplomacy?</b><br>
	If you asked this question, you have my sympathy that you managed to
	live long enough to form intelligent questions without becoming
	acquainted with -- nay, addicted to -- Diplomacy.  I won't answer the
	question here, but will instead refer you to the Internet home page
	of the Diplomacy hobby, <a href=<POUCH>>The
	Diplomatic Pouch</a>, where you can find the answer you seek.
	The Pouch is chock full of more information on The Game
	than you can digest in one sitting -- one place to start is
	<a href=<URL>/Welcome.html>The Pouch's "Welcome"
	page</a>, where I wrote a quickie overview of Diplomacy itself.
	<i>(Head for The Pouch now, because
	the rest of these questions are answered assuming that you are familiar
	with Diplomacy, and most Payola players cut their teeth on the standard
	game first before trying to deal with the possibility that their
	own units won't obey orders.)</i>

		<b>Okay, so I am playing Diplomacy with a treasury full
of Monopoly money.  How much do I have and how and when do I get more?</b><br>
	There are a number of answers to this question, because there are
	different "flavors" of Payola.  What I describe here is the income
	scheme for the standard game of Payola.  Players start the game with
	a treasury based on the number of supply centers owned by each power.
	Then, players receive "tax" income, an amount again
	based on the number of supply centers held by that player,
	once per game-year -- immediately after the Fall phases of the game.
	The amount of "tax" income is a simple decreasing sequence.  You receive
	17 silver pieces if you own one supply center, 17+16 if you own two,
	17+16+15 if you own three, etc.
	<P>
	As I mentioned, that is only one of a number of recognized income
	models.  Others include
	<ul>
	<li>the "flat tax" model, in which all
		supply centers are worth the same amount of annual income,
	<li>the "economic" model, in which each individual supply center
		is separately valued, and is worth a specific, variable, annual income,
		and
	<li>the "zero sum" model, in which all supply centers are worth
		ten silver pieces awarded once only, funds are transferred from one
		player to another when a supply center changes hands,
		and all of the money paid as bribes to each player's units during
		the game-year is added to that player's
		treasury at the end of the year (in standard Payola, money spent on
		accepted bribes is gone forever; spent by the generals and admirals
		at the officers' club).
	</ul>

<P><b>Do I need to spend all my money every phase or
game-year?  Is the money one of those "use it or lose it" things?
</b><br>
	No, you most certainly do <i>not</i> need to spend all your money.
	In fact, since you only receive money at the end of each year, you
	would be very foolish to spend all your money in the Spring turn of
	a year!  You should save as much as you think you can.  Someday, you
	will hopefully have a big treasure chest full of loot that you can
	use to pay an enemy army to simply step aside and let you walk into
	the supply center that gives you a solo victory.

<P><b>Before I ask you how to bribe a unit, is that 
the only thing I can do with my money?</b><br>
	No, you can transfer some or all of it to any other player.  You can do 
	this at any time, and the transfer is instantaneous.  Players take
	advantage of this capability to make amends for little "accidental" moves
	their units make, and to signal peaceful intentions in games without
	press.

		<b>Okay, I'm ready to learn how to bribe the pieces now.
How do I do it?  What are the different types of bribes I can offer to
the pieces on the board?</b><br>
	In Payola, there are five different types of bribes.  Here are examples
	of each, with an explanation:
	<ul>
	<p><li><b>Direct Bribe.</b>  The offer below is a promise to pay four
		"silver pieces" if the army in Paris attempts to move to Burgundy.
		<dd><tt>4 : A PAR - BUR</tt></dd><br>
		Direct bribes are the most common of the bribe types.  Many players
		use only direct bribes throughout a game.
	<p><li><b>Negative Bribe.</b>  The offer below is a promise to pay four
		"silver pieces" if the army in Paris does <u>not</u> attempt to
		move to Burgundy.
		<dd><tt>4 ! A PAR - BUR</tt></dd><br>
		As long as the army in Paris does anything <i>other than</i> try
		to move to Burgundy, the treasury of the player issuing this bribe
		will be debited four silver pieces.
	<p><li><b>Move Bribe.</b> The offer below is a promise to pay four "silver
		pieces if the army in Paris tries to move either to Burgundy or
		to anywhere else.
		<dd><tt>4 &gt; A PAR - BUR</tt></dd><br>
		Yes, that's right.  If the army in Paris attempts to move
		<i>any</i>where (not just to Burgundy, but to any space adjacent
		to Paris), it will cost the player four silver pieces from his
		treasury.
	<p><li><b>Hold Bribe.</b> The offer below is a promise to pay four
		"silver pieces" if the army in Paris either does not attempt
		to move at all, or attempts to move only to Burgundy.
		<dd><tt>4 @ A PAR - BUR</tt></dd><br>
		Because the order I included in the above example is a <i>move</i>
		order, the meaning of the example order may seem a bit confusing, so
		let me explain.  The at-sign
		in the offer does indeed mean that the amount offered will be paid if
		the unit does <i>not</i> move.  That is, four silver pieces will be
		paid if the unit issues
		a <tt>HOLD</tt> or <tt>SUPPORT</tt> order.  But four silver pieces
		are <i>also</i> offered for any order or orders mentioned in the
		offer, whether it is a stationary order or not, so
		an attempt to move from to Burgundy would also cost the player those
		four silver pieces.
	<p><li><b>Gift Bribe.</b>  The offer below is a promise to pay four
		"silver pieces" <i>no matter what order is issued</i> to the army
		in Paris.
		<dd><tt>4 &amp; A PAR - BUR</tt></dd><br>
		Yes, you read that right.  A gift bribe is a simple drain on your
		treasury.  Whatever the army in Paris does, it's going to cost you
		four silver pieces if you offered this bribe.  You probably are
		not surprised to hear that the gift bribe is
		very rarely used in practice.
	</ul>

<P><b>Can I offer more than one bribe to a single unit?</b><br>
	Yes, you can.  Here are some examples:
	<ul>
	<p><li>Let's say that you didn't care whether
	the army in Paris moved to Burgundy or Gascony but that you're willing
	to pay four silver pieces if it attempts either one of these moves.
	You could write this as follows:
	<dd><tt>4 : A PAR - BUR<br>4 : A PAR - GAS</tt></dd><br>
	Note that because the move to Burgundy is listed first, the unit will
	prefer that over the move to Gascony if it comes down to a choice between
	these two orders.
	<P><li>You can also use a shorthand syntax to express this same set of two
	offers as a single offer:
	<dd><tt>4 : A PAR - BUR | - GAS</tt></dd><br>
	The vertical bar comes in handy.  The only thing to remember is that
	you do <i>not</i> list the unit's type (<tt>A</tt>) and its
	current location (<tt>PAR</tt>) more than once in the offer.
	<p><li>
	Multiple offers to the same unit have other more varied uses.
	For example, let's say you wished to 
	would pay four silver pieces for Paris to move anywhere (probably because
	you want
	to make sure that the army would be unsupportable on the upcoming turn),
	but that for some reason 
	you are willing to pay two <i>extra</i> silver pieces if it moves
	to Burgundy as opposed to anywhere else.  You could express this with
	the bribes:
	<dd><tt>4 &gt; A PAR - BUR<br>2 : A PAR - BUR</tt></dd><br>
	</ul>

<P><b>How do I ask a unit <i><u>not</u></i> to do more than one thing?</b><br>
	You may have realized that the following offers:
	<ul><dd><tt>4 ! A PAR - BUR<br>4 ! A PAR - GAS</tt></dd></ul>
	(which say "four silver pieces if you don't move to Burgundy" and
	"four silver pieces if you don't move to Gascony," respectively) will end up
	costing the player four silver pieces if the unit actually <i>does</i>
	attempt to move to Burgundy or Gascony, and <i>eight</i> silver
	pieces if it is issued any <i>other</i> order.
	<P>
	What the player probably wished to say was "four if you don't move
	to Burgundy <i><u>and</u></i> you don't move to Gascony."  This bribe
	<i>must</i> be expressed using the vertical bar, like this:
	<ul><dd><tt>4 ! A PAR - BUR | - GAS</tt></dd></ul>

		<b>Can I pay a foreign unit to support me in my attempt
to dislodge another unit owned by that same foreign power?</b><br>
Yes and no.  Yes, you can pay the unit, and yes, it will issue the support
(and take your money).  However, remember this: units follow <i>all</i> the
standard
Diplomacy rules, no matter who pays them.  So the support you bought will
be invalid when it comes to aiding in the dislodge.  For example, if
the following orders are bought and paid for:
<center><table><tr><td>
<tt>English F MAO-Por
<br>&nbsp;French A Por H
<br>&nbsp;French A Spa S F MAO-Por</tt>
</table></center>
the French unit in Portugal will remain and the English attack will fail,
because -- by rule -- a French support cannot cause a French dislodgement.

<P><b>Is my money for a particular order combined with
money that other players offer for that same order?</b><br>
	Yes, it is.  If you offer Paris some of your silver pieces to move to
	Burgundy, and if any one (or more) of the other players offer Paris some
	of their own silver pieces for the same order, the army will indeed
	consider the multiple offers
	as if they were a single, consolidated offer to pay it the sum total of
	all the monies offered by the separate players.

<P><b>What if I offer money for a fleet in Constantinople
to move to the east coast of Bulgaria, and someone else offers it money
to move to the <i>south</i> coast.  Are our bribes combined?</b><br>
	No.  Those are two separate orders.

<P><b>What if I wish to <i>support</i> a Constantinople
fleet's move to a particular coast of Bulgaria?  The Website is not
letting me enter the bribe offer.  How do I do it?</b><br>
	You cannot.  You may offer support for the fleet to move to Bulgaria,
	but not to a specific coast of Bulgaria.  This is the proper implementation
	of the Diplomacy rules -- support is directed to a <i>space</i>, not to
	a specific <i>coast</i>.

		<b>What about ties?  If my offer is for the same amount as
another player's offer, what will the unit do?</b><br>
	If two (or more) orders would pay a unit the same amount of money, one of
	these will be preferred over the other by virtue of the tie-breakers.
	The mechanism that implements the tie-breaker is the "acceptance list."
	Every player has an "acceptance list" on file, and it applies to all
	offers made to his own units.  An acceptance list of <tt>EFRTIGA</tt>
	means that, among tied offers, any with money offered by England (listed
	first in the "acceptance list") are preferred over those without.
	Players can update their acceptance lists at any time during the game.
	<i>(I will not go further here in explaining the use of the "acceptance
	list" to break ties -- for more information, see Section 4 of
	<a href=<POUCH>/Zine/W1995A/Payola>the rules to
	Payola</a>.)</i>

<P><b>Does the acceptance list really matter?  Do I really
need to keep an eye on it and change it every season?</b><br>
	Well, you can check the data for all the completed Payola games (bribe
	histories become public knowledge at the end of the game) to find instances
	where the acceptance list came into play to break a tie, but the fact is
	that, in practice, these are few and far between.  As long as you have
	your own power at the front of your acceptance list, you can probably
	feel pretty safe.  Many players play an entire game without changing their
	acceptance list once.  However, don't take this as a recommendation.
	A player who meticulously updates his acceptance list to reflect the
	changing attitudes of other players toward him will have
	an advantage over those who don't, if ever the occasion arrives.
	<P>
	The reason why the acceptance list is not of paramount importance is
	that
	if you have a unit that is being bribed to do something you don't
	want it to do, it probably doesn't matter to you whether the power
	doing the bribing is someone you thought was your friend or someone
	you knew was your enemy.  Therefore, when you have a unit deciding
	between two tied
	orders -- neither of which includes money (or even a zero silver piece
	bid) offered by you -- does it really
	matter which of them it accepts?  Yes, it will accept the one more
	preferred by the power you listed earlier in your acceptance list, but
	can you really be sure that this order is the one truly more preferred
	by you??  Nope.
	<P>
	There could be cases, however, when you just don't have the money to
	do what you want so you leave ordering your units in the hands of
	a (hopefully) loyal ally -- not loyal enough to transfer you some money
	to handle the problem yourself, though, apparently.  Assuming he
	doesn't cross you up, you might
	want to be sure to list him high in your acceptance list to avoid the
	risk of his being one silver
	piece short on a crucial bid, which then goes to a tie-break that is
	decided against him.  However, since you can issue zero AgP bribes to your
	own units -- and assuming you list yourself at the front of your acceptance
	list (you'd rarely not do so!) -- you can tip the balance in favor of
	your ally's planned bids to your units, even if he is listed dead-last
	in your acceptance list.  In fact, you may want to do just that -- list
	him last, so that if he does cross you up, his bids won't match your
	zero silver piece "helper bids," and his bids will run the risk of losing
	a tie-break to a bribe made by another power.  (Of course, if this happens,
	it just means that your
	unit is controlled by someone you considered to be even more against you
	than your would-be treacherous "friend," and that you've allowed that
	"friend" to save the money he was about to stab you with so that he can
	use it to try to do so again next season!  If he honestly tells you
	how much he spent, though,
	in attempting the bribe -- lying to you only about what the order was
	that he listed in his bribe -- you can tell from your account statement
	that he lost a tie-break, and his treachery will be exposed to you.)

		<b>Can I offer bribes whose amounts total to
more money than I have in my treasury?</b><br>
	Yes, you can.  But of course, if you do, and if enough of your bribes
	turn out to be accepted, you won't be able to afford them all.  If this
	happens, your bribes are automatically devalued and the units try again
	to see if they can meet your demands without leaving you bankrupt.
	This all happens behind the scenes, simultaneously for all such
	"overgenerous" players, and is done as follows:
	<ul>
	<li>
	First, <i>every single one</i> of your offers is <i>reduced</i> by a single
	"silver piece."  That is,
	<dd><tt>4 : A PAR - BUR</tt></dd><br>
	becomes
	<dd><tt>3 : A PAR - BUR</tt></dd>
	<li>Then <i>all the units on the board</i> start all over again deciding
	what order they will issue.  What you could have bought for four silver
	pieces, you might not be able to buy for three.
	<li>If, after the units
	decide on their orders <i>again</i>, you are <i>still</i> promising them
	more than you could pay, your offers are <i>all</i> reduced by
	<i>another</i> "silver piece."  This continues until you can afford to
	pay all the units that accept your bribes.
	</ul>

<P><b>Okay, I understand.  If I overcommit, all of my bribes
will be reduced one silver piece, then re-offered to the various units,
with this reduction and re-offering repeated if necessary.
What if there are some of my bribe offers that I care less about than others?
Can I somehow have these less important offers reduce at a faster rate, in
order to give the others a better chance to be accepted?</b><br>
    Yes, you can.  The way you do this is by splitting any offer that
	you wish to have reduce quicker than by one silver piece into
	multiple parts.  For example, if you
	wish to offer an eight silver piece offer for Paris to move to Burgundy,
    but you wish it to reduce by two silver pieces rather
    than by one, you would split the offer into two parts:
    <ul><dd><tt>4 : A PAR - BUR<dd>4 : A PAR - BUR</tt></dd></ul>
<!--
Planning how quickly your bids would reduce can be
a good way to implement different campaign possibilities. With some orders
decreasing faster than others, if it turns out you can't afford your
preferred campaign, an alternate plan (its bribes reducing slower) could
become the more attractive to the units to which you're making offers.
<P>
For (an oversimplified) example, if your treasury contains twenty silver
pieces and you wish to stab your ally Germany, but only if you can walk into
<i>both</i> of the centers he's left open to you (otherwise, you will follow
the plan you have negotiated with him), your offer sheet might look like this:
    <ul><dd><tt>
	10 : A BUR - MUN<br>
	10 : A BUR - MUN<br>
	10 : A RUH - KIE<br>
	10 : A RUH - KIE<br>
	20 : A RUH S A BEL<br>
	20 : A BUR S A BEL
	</tt></dd></ul>
With this offer sheet, the orders to take Munich and Kiel are preferred
to those that offer support to Belgium.  However, the highest
price you would pay for both these "campaigns" is the same (40 silver
pieces).  If you can afford
-->
<P><b>
That sounds neat, but it seems like I can only do this kind of planned
reduction if
I structure my bids to make <i>sure</i> to overspend my treasury.  Is there
any way I can set some of my money aside -- maybe it's only Spring and I
need to make sure to have money for the Fall phase --
and still have all the same bribing flexibility?
</b><br>
	Yes, there is.  You can specify with your offers that -- no
	matter what happens -- you wish to be left with a specific amount of money
	after the units are given their orders.  This is done by including a
	"savings request" with your bribes.  For example, to guarantee that
	your treasury will contain at least twenty-five "silver pieces" after
	the current turn, include the line:
	<ul><dd><tt>25 $</tt></dd></ul>
	with your offers.
	(Note that if you include more than one savings request in an
	offer sheet, they will be totaled to create a single request.)
	The savings request simply means that if enough of your bribes would be
	accepted to leave you with fewer silver pieces than requested,
	your bribes are subjected to the one-silver-piece-at-a-time
	devaluation described above, until all the acceptable offers
	are also payable without violating your savings request.
	<P><b>
Is there any other money-management tool
or technique I can take advantage of?</b><br>
	Yes, there is one more; the "bribe plateau."  You can give
	any of your bribe offers a "plateau" amount, which comes into play
	if your bribes need to be reduced.  Each bribe, as discussed above,
	is reduced in value by a single silver piece; <i>however</i>, a bribe
	is never reduced lower than its "plateau" amount unless and
	until <i>every one</i> of the
	player's bribes reaches its plateau.  Here is an example:
	<ul><dd><tt>8#4 : A PAR - BUR</tt></dd></ul>
	This bribe is for eight silver pieces, but directs that it should not
	be reduced (if reduction is necessary) to any amount lower than four
	silver pieces.  The only way this bribe could be reduced to offer an
	amount of three "silver pieces" or fewer is if all of the player's
	bribes are reduced to their plateau amounts
	but the player is still "overextended" -- if this happens, this bribe
	and all of this player's other bribes will then "forget their plateau"
	and continue to be reduced, down to zero if need be.
	<P>
	Any bribe offer that does not include a pound-sign character to indicate a
	plateau has a plateau amount of zero.  Additionally, a useful shorthand
	is recognized:  the offer
	<ul><dd><tt>8# : A PAR - BUR</tt></dd></ul>
	is an eight "silver piece" offer that should not be reduced at all.
	That is, it is equivalent to:
	<ul><dd><tt>8#8 : A PAR - BUR</tt></dd></ul>

<b>What about retreat and adjustment phases?  Do I bribe
units during those phases of the game too?</b><br>
	No.  All of a player's retreat, build, and remove orders are under the
	control of that individual player acting alone.  In these phases,
	a Payola game is  just like a standard Diplomacy game.
	Just as you enter your movement phase bribe offers at the Website,
	you can issue your retreat and adjustment phase orders here too.

<P><b>
When are bribes adjudicated? Will moves process before the deadline if
all players have submitted their bribes?
</b><br>
	The short answer to the second question
	is, "Yes; assuming no player has set his <i>wait flag</i>."
	The complete answer to this and other similar questions can be found on the
	Webpage that answers the
	<a href=<URL>?page=Questions>Common Questions About the DPjudge</a>.  The
	complete processing mechanics is described there.  Simply
	remember to read "bribe offers" when it talks about "movement orders."

		<b>What if a unit doesn't receive any bribe at all?
What will it do?</b><br>
	It will <tt>HOLD</tt>.  This is because if a player offers no
	non-negative bribe to one of his own units, a default bribe for that unit
	to <tt>HOLD</tt> --
	offering to pay zero "silver pieces" -- is automatically entered for him
	at the end of his list of offers.

<P><b>What if the only bribe a unit gets is a "negative" bribe?  What will the unit do?</b><br>
	Again, it will <tt>HOLD</tt>.
	This is explained as follows:  each negative bribe that does not ask
	for the unit to <tt>HOLD</tt> "comes with" a
	"hidden" direct bribe offer to pay zero silver pieces if the unit is
	ordered to <tt>HOLD</tt>, and it is this bribe -- the only positive
	("do this") offer that the unit gets -- which is followed.
	<P>
	Ah, you say, but what if the bribe offer
	is one that asks for the unit <i>not</i> to <tt>HOLD</tt>?  As in
	<ul><dd><tt>4 ! A PAR H</tt></dd></ul>
	It doesn't matter.  The unit will still <tt>HOLD</tt> (the bribing
	player will <i>not</i> be charged four silver pieces, however).  The
	bribe that will be accepted is the owning player's default (automatically
	created) zero silver piece offer <tt>HOLD</tt> offer.
	<P>
	The thing to remember about negative bribes is that they never give a
	unit an order that it can consider.  Units <i>only</i> look at the
	<i>non-</i>negative offers made to them when deciding what order to follow.
	Money that is offered in a negative bribe is <i>added</i> as appropriate,
	to each non-negative bribe that fits its requirements, of course, but
	there must be some non-negative bribe to catch the money or it essentially
	goes unoffered.  The lesson is that if you ever offer a unit money
	<i>not</i> to <tt>HOLD</tt>, be sure to offer it a "direct" bribe
	as well, just in case your money has nothing to which it can be added.

<P><b>Wait a minute.  In the rules it says that a player
cannot offer a zero silver piece bribe to any unit that he doesn't own.  But,
in the answer to that last question, you said that a zero silver piece
bribe for a unit to <tt>HOLD</tt> is automatically paired with every single
negative bribe offer.  What gives?</b><br>
	The restriction against zero silver piece bribes to foreign units is real,
	but it applies only to offers actually written by a player.
	The zero silver piece bribe to <tt>HOLD</tt> which is added automatically
	is exempt from this prohibition.

		<b>Can I set a bookmark (fans of Bill Gates: a "favorite")
that will get me straight to my Payola game?</b><br>
	Yes.  Paste the following lines together into a single line, with
	no included whitespace, and there you have it:<br><tt>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		http://www.floc.net/dpjudge?<br>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		game=<font color=red><i>gameName</i></font>&<br>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		power=<font color=red><i>powerName</i></font>&<br>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		password=<font color=red><i>yourPassword</i></font></tt>
<P><b>How do I change my password at the Payola Place 
Website?</b><br>
	You must use the e-mail interface to do this (sending a
	<tt>SET&nbsp;ADDRESS</tt> or <tt>SET&nbsp;PASSWORD</tt> command).
	See <a href=<URL>?page=Email#8>the details on these commands</a>
	in the <a href=<URL>?page=Email>questions about the DPjudge
	e-mail interface</a>.
	<P>
	If your game is running on a Ken Lowe judge, using the DPjudge as a
	Web front-end,
	your Payola Place password <i>must</i> match your password on the Ken Lowe
	judge computer that is running the game.  So if you ever change your
	password for the game on the judge, you should be <i>sure</i> to have
	your Payola Place password changed <i>immediately</i>.
<P><b>Where can I get a PostScript viewer so that I can
	see the "Season By Season" Maps?</b><br>
	At the <a href=http://www.cs.wisc.edu/~ghost>Ghostscript, Ghostview,
	and GSview</a> site.  You need ghostscript (which is called <tt>gs</tt>
	if you need it for a Personal Computer) <b><u>and</u></b> ghostview
	(<tt>gsview32</tt> for the PC).  Downloading and installing ghostview
	(<tt>gsview32</tt>) should drag ghostscript along with it and set you
	all up.  It should even tell your Web browser to use gsview to view
	PostScript files (if it doesn't, you can teach your Web browser to
	do so yourself).  Note that you will want to set the "Orientation"
	in ghostview to "Seascape" to show the map right-side-up.

<P><b>So there's an e-mail interface I can use to submit
my offers and orders and send my press messages?  What do I need to
know?</b><br>
	Yes, you can submit your bribe offers and your retreat and adjustment
	orders by e-mail -- just include them somewhere under your <tt>SIGNON</tt>
	(and outside of a press message!)
	Speaking of press, yes, in addition to being able to compose and send
	press from the Website, you can also
	send it from your favorite e-mail application.  Everything
	you need to know about how to do all this is in the
	<a href=<URL>?page=Email>E-Mail Interface Question
	and Answer List</a>.
