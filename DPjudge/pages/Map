<blockquote><br>
The DPjudge already supports a number of existing map variants, each of
which is implemented by a <tt>.map</tt> file in the format described here,
and an accompanying "Manusized" PostScript (<tt>.ps</tt>) graphical template
file.
You can view each of these files as a working example of a DPjudge
<tt>.map</tt> file.

&nbsp;<br>
If you can create a <tt>.map</tt> file of your own, and send it in,
along with an appropriately formatted (Manusized) <tt>.ps</tt>
file, you can add to the map variants supported by the DPjudge.
Creating a <tt>.map</tt> file is easy.  It is the creation of the
accompanying <tt>.ps</tt> file that is (currently) difficult, mostly due to the
fact that Manus is very particular -- the map must look very very good to
be accepted.  Take a look at the <tt>.ps</tt> files

<p><dt><b><tt># <i>comment...</i></tt></b><dd>
	Any line that has a pound sign (<tt>#</tt>) as its first non-whitespace
	character will be considered a comment, and ignored.  Comments must
	span a complete line (that is, you may not add a comment to the end
	of a non-comment line).

<p><dt><b><tt>USE[S] <i>fileName...</i></tt></b><dd>
	This line causes another file to be immediately read in.  This is used
	to share map information.  For example, the <tt>britain.map</tt> file
	<tt>USES</tt> the <tt>standard.geography</tt> file, which contains
	all the geography for the standard Diplomacy map.

<p><dt><b><tt>MAP <i>mapName</i></tt></b><dd>
	This line is identical to <tt>USE <i>mapName</i>.map</tt> with the
	additional provision that the graphical map template (used to generate
	the actual visual map) will be the one having the <tt><i>mapName</i></tt>
	specified.  For example, the "fleetRome" map
	not only <tt>USE</tt>s the same map data (slightly altered) as the
	standard map, but also uses the same graphical map for display (and
	therefore, the <tt>MAP</tt> command is proper for that variant).  By
	contrast, the "britain" and "crowded" maps may <tt>USE</tt> (that is,
	load and then alter) the data from the standard map file, but (due to
	the additional SC dots that must be depicted on the map to support
	these variants), they use different
	graphical maps than does the standard game, so the <tt>USE</tt>
	command (rather than <tt>MAP</tt>) is proper for these variants.

<p><dt><b><tt>TEXTONLY</i></tt></b><dd>
	This line specifies that no graphical map should be made for games
	using this map file.  This is useful to allow testing of adjudication
	and other play details without dependency on a PostScript template map
	file, which may be later in development.

<p><dt><b><tt>[<i>oldAbbrev</i> ->] <i>placeName</i> = <i>abbreviation alias...</i></tt></b><dd>
	This type of line specifies all the recognized aliases for a map location.
	The <tt><i>placeName</i></tt> is the long form of the map location (the
	form to appear in results mailings).  The <tt><i>abbreviation</i></tt>
	is the DPjudge standard abbreviation for the place-name (the form to
	appear in all orders when shown to the player on his Web pages).
	This standard abbreviation must be exactly three characters long
	and must both begin and end with an alphabetic
	or numeric character.  Each <tt><i>alias</i></tt> is a single word (that
	is, having no embedded spaces) that is to be recognized as another name
	for the location in question. <!-- (each <tt><i>alias</i></tt> will be
	translated to the DPjudge standard <tt><i>abbreviation</i></tt>). -->
	If you wish to specify an alias that is more than a single word in
	length, you must join the separate words using plus-sign characters
	(<tt>+</tt>).  For example,<br>
	<tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
	Norwegian Sea = nwg norwegian nrg norwsea norw+sea</tt>
	<p>
	If an <tt><i>alias</i></tt> ends with a question-mark (<tt>?</tt>),
	it must not contain a plus-sign, and this indicates that the
	<tt><i>alias</i></tt> (without the question-mark) is to be considered
	"ambiguous." Ambiguous aliases may not be used in games that use the
	<tt>NO_CHECK</tt> rule (the ambiguity will be reported to the player
	at the time of order-entry).  For example, <tt>TYR</tt> is an ambiguous
	alias in the standard game map, since it is commonly used as an alias
	for both Tyrolia and the Tyrrhenian Sea.
	<P>
	If the <tt><i>placeName</i></tt> is preceded on the line by an
	<tt><i>oldAbbrev</i></tt> and an arrow (<tt>-&gt;</tt>), this
	indicates that the location being named is a pre-existing location
	whose abbreviation is currently <tt><i>oldAbbrev</i></tt>.  This allows
	you to completely rename a map location, and/or provide a different
	standard <tt><i>abbreviation</i></tt> or a different set of
	<tt><i>alias</i></tt>es.  When renaming a location in this way, all
	existing information about that location (such as adjacencies to this
	location from other locations) is automatically adjusted to reflect the
	new <tt><i>abbreviation</i></tt> instead.  Note that if you wish to
	rename a multi-coast space, every coast must be separately renamed.
	That is, if the map defines <tt>SPA</tt> and <tt>SPA/SC</tt> and
	<tt>SPA/NC</tt>, it is <u>not</u> sufficient to simply rename <tt>SPA</tt>;
	separate rename directives must also be given for the coastal regions
	or they will retain their original name, abbreviation, and aliases.

<p><dt><b><tt>COAST <i>abbreviation</i> [ABUTS [<i>abut...</i>]]</tt> -or-
<br><tt>LAND&nbsp; <i>abbreviation</i> [ABUTS [<i>abut...</i>]]</tt> -or-

<br><tt>AMEND <i>abbreviation</i> [ABUTS [<i>abut...</i>]]</tt></b>
<dd>
	This type of line specifies the terrain type and adjacencies for
	the place-name whose <tt><i>abbreviation</i></tt> is given.
	The <tt><i>terrain</i></tt> must be either <tt>WATER</tt>, <tt>LAND</tt>,
	<tt>COAST</tt>, <tt>PORT</tt>, <tt>SHUT</tt> (impassable), or
	<tt>AMEND</tt>.  The only
	difference between <tt>PORT</tt> and <tt>COAST</tt> spaces is that fleets
	located in <tt>PORT</tt> spaces may convoy armies as if they were in water.
	<P>
	If the <tt><i>terrain</i></tt> is <tt>AMEND</tt>, all pre-existing
	data for the <tt>abbreviation</tt> (from an earlier such line) will
	be retained, and the adjacency information given on the line will
	<i>modify</i> that which is already on record.
	If an area listed to the right of <tt>ABUTS</tt> begins with a dash
	(<tt>-</tt>), then the area is <i>removed</i> (if possible) from any
	pre-existing list of adjacencies for the location in question.
	<p>
	In all <i>other</i> cases (that is, if the <tt><i>terrain</i></tt> is
	<u>not</u> <tt>AMEND</tt>), the adjacency information given on this
	line will silently <i>supplant</i> (become valid <i>instead of</i>)
	any previous such line for the same location.  In this way, maps can be
	changed on the fly, such that what was a <tt>LAND</tt> location can become
	<tt>COAST</tt> or <tt>WATER</tt> and/or can obtain different adjacencies.
	<P>
	The <i><tt>abut</tt></i> locations must be the DPjudge standard
	abbreviations (the first abbreviation given after the equals-sign in each
	<tt><i>placename</i></tt> line).
	<P>
	<i><b><u>Specifying Army and Fleet Restrictions</u></b></i><br>
	This directive is case-sensitive.  Army and fleet restrictions are
	specifyied by use of upper- and lower-case as described below.
	Everything must be in upper-case <i><u>except</u></i> the following:
	<ul>
	<li>The <tt><i>abbreviation</i></tt> for any <tt>COAST</tt> location that
		a fleet cannot occupy <i><u>must</u> be listed entirely in
		lowercase</i>.  For instance, on the standard map, Spain
		must be listed as <tt>spa</tt>
		since fleets may only occupy either <tt>SPA/SC</tt> or
		<tt>SPA/NC</tt>.
		Specifying a location using lower-case after the same location was
		given earlier using upper-case, or vice-versa, will cause the previous
		location's terrain type and adjacencies to be forgotten (or, in the
		case of <tt>AMEND</tt>, will cause the previous location to be converted
		to the new casing, and its adjacencies preserved so they can be modified
		by the <tt>AMEND</tt> directive).
	<li>In the list of adjacencies, <i><u>any</u></i> 
		location that a fleet could occupy but into which a fleet
		can<u>not</u> move from the location in question <i><u>must</u>
		be listed entirely in lowercase</i>.  For
		example, on the standard map, Tuscany must be listed as <tt>tus</tt>
		in the list of locations adjacent to <tt>VEN</tt>, since
		a fleet cannot move directly from Venice to Tuscany.
	<li>In the list of adjacencies, <i><u>any</u></i> <tt>LAND</tt> or
		<tt>COAST</tt> location to which an army can<u>not</u> make a direct
		(non-convoyed) move from the location in question <i><u>must</u>
		be listed with its first character in uppercase and the remainder
		in lower-case.</i>  This is useful to specify offshore islands, and
		therefore no example on the standard map can be given.  Consider,
		however, allowing an army to be convoyed into the Tyrrhenian Sea
		(call it Sicily).  To implement this, the Tyrrhenian Sea would be
		given the terrain type <tt>PORT</tt> (to allow both fleets and armies
		to occupy the space and to allow fleets in that
		space to convoy) and all land spaces adjacent to the Tyrrhenian Sea
		would list their adjacency to that space as <tt>Tys</tt> (rather
		than <tt>TYS</tt> or <tt>tys</tt>) to indicate than an army may
		not move directly to the space despite the fact that movement from
		a <tt>COAST</tt> (such as Naples) to an adjacent <tt>PORT</tt> (the
		Tyrrhenian) would otherwise be allowed.  Convoyed movement would
		be allowed, though, so an order such as <tt>A&nbsp;Nap-ION-TYS</tt>
		would be perfectly valid.
	</ul>
	<P>
	<i><b><u>Specifying Multi-Coast Spaces</u></b></i><br>
	<ul>
	<li>If an area abuts a multi-coast province, its adjacencies must list
		<i><u>only</u></i> the coasts that are reachable, and must <u>not</u>
		list the main space itself (for example, <tt>RUM</tt> is listed as being
		adjacent to <tt>BUL/EC</tt>, but <u>not</u> to <tt>BUL</tt> itself).
	<li>The line for every coast of a province should appear
		in the map file <i>before</i> the line for the space itself.
	<li>If the map will undergo terrain changes during play,
		it is important to note that the fleet-friendly space listed
		<i>last</i> is the one on which a unit in that space will be put if
		a terrain modification requires it.  For example, if a fleet is in
		Rome when Venice becomes a <tt>WATER</tt> space, the map file
		will need to direct that Rome becomes a multi-coast province by
		adding entries for <tt>ROM/EC</tt>, <tt>ROM/WC</tt>, and <tt>rom</tt>.
		By listing <tt>ROM/WC</tt> <i><u>after</u></i> <tt>ROM/EC</tt>, the
		fleet in Rome will be placed on the west (rather than the east) coast.
	</ul>
	<P>
	<i><b><u>Power Restrictions and One-Way Adjacencies</u></b></i><br>
	An <tt><i>abut</i></tt> location (appearing to the right of <tt>ABUTS</tt>)
	may optionally be preceded by one or more power abbreviations, separated
	from the location abbreviation by a colon.  This indicates that movement
	across the adjacency is only allowed for units owned by the listed
	power(s).  For example,
	<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;COAST&nbsp;SPA&nbsp;ABUTS&nbsp;EI:NAF</tt><br>
	indicates that an English or Italian unit in Spain may move directly
	to North Africa (and may support actions in North Africa).  Units owned by
	other powers do not have this capability.  Power abbreviations are not
	necessarily required before the colon; if none are given, the adjacency
	will be essentially impassable by all units.  This is useful to set up
	one-way adjacencies, such as the following example:
	<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WATER&nbsp;SKA&nbsp;ABUTS&nbsp;BAL<br>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WATER&nbsp;BAL&nbsp;ABUTS&nbsp;:SKA</tt><br>
	This indicates that a unit may move from Skagerrak to the Baltic Sea,
	but not vice-versa.  Without the <tt>:SKA</tt>, the map would be declared
	to be in error, as one-way adjacencies are otherwise illegal.
	<P>
	<i><b><u>Center Ownership Restrictions</u></b></i><br>
	Further restriction on the power eligible to use an adjacency may be
	made by supplying any number of comma-separated supply centers in a
	parenthesized list at the end of the abut location.  For example,
	<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;BLA&nbsp;ABUTS&nbsp;AEG(CON,SMY)</tt><br>
	indicates that a unit in
	the Black Sea is adjacent to the Aegean Sea if and only if the power
	that owns the unit also owns both Constantinople and Smyrna.
	<P>
	<i><b><u>Special Restrictions</u></b></i><br>
	After considering any power and center ownership restrictions that may
	be given, then
	if an area listed to the right of <tt>ABUTS</tt> begins or ends with
	any <i>non-alphabetic character or characters</I>, all such characters
	specify restrictions on the adjacency (these are special restrictions;
	beyond those covered by the upper- and lower-case rules listed above).  The
	recognized restrictions are as follows:
	<blockquote>
	<dl>
	<dt><b><tt>~</tt> (tilde)</b>
		<i>[implementing weak movement across straits]</i>
	<ol type=a>
	<li>Support cannot be offered across the adjacency.
	<li>Movement across the adjacency has no strength (except that given by
		any supporting units).  This means that even if the move is made
		with one valid support, a unit <tt>HOLD</tt>ing at the destination
		will not be dislodged.  This also means that an unsupported move
		across the boundary will not cut any support being offered by a
		unit at the destination.
	</ol>
	</dt>
	<P>
	<dt><b><tt>*</tt> (asterisk)</b>
		<i>[implementing the Cape of Good Hope Rule from the 1900 Variant]</i>
	<ol type=a>
	<li>Movement across the adjacency (to the listed space) is done at
		half-strength.  This includes convoyed movement whose final step
		is the crossing of the adjacency.
	<li>Support cannot be offered across the adjacency.
	<li>Movement across the adjacency does not cut any support being offered
		by a unit at the destination (unless the move dislodges the supporting
		unit, of course).
	<li>Any unit attempting to retreat across the adjacency is destroyed if
		any other retreating unit attempts a retreat to the destination
		space (the other unit succeeds in its retreat attempt).
	</ol>
	</dt>
	</dl>
	</blockquote>

<p><dt><b><tt>DROP <i>abbreviation...</i></tt></b><dd>
	This line will remove <i>all</i> data that was given concerning the
	place(s) with the specified <tt><i>abbreviation</i></tt>(s), including all
	adjacency information.  That is, all record of the space will be
	forgotten, and no space will be left thinking that it is adjacent to the
	<tt>DROP</tt>ped location.  <tt>DROP</tt>ping a multi-coast space,
	without designating any particular coast, will also <tt>DROP</tt> all
	information for each of the coasts.  That is, <tt>DROP&nbsp;SPA</tt>,
	used on the standard map, will remove all information on Spain, Spain
	(north coast), and Spain (south coast).

<p><dt><b><tt><i>powerName</i> [([<i>ownWord</i>][:[<i>abbrev</i>]])]

</b><dd>
	This type of line is used to specify a power name, its "ownership word" and
	single-letter abbreviation (for instance, England's ownership word would
	be "English", and abbreviation would be "E") and all centers that serve as
	the home centers for the power.  If the <tt><i>ownWord</i></tt> is omitted,
	the <tt><i>powerName</i></tt> is used for this purpose, and if the
	<tt><i>abbrev</i></tt> is omitted, the initial letter of the
	<tt><i>ownWord</i></tt> is used as the abbreviation.
	<P>
	Any and all leading underscores (<tt>_</tt>) in a <tt><i>powerName</i></tt>
	will <u>not</u> be displayed when the power is referred to in results and
	on the graphical map.  This is useful to cause powers to alphabetize
	after others (and thus be displayed in a specific order in the results
	and on the graphical map).
	<P>
	A plus-sign (<tt>+</tt>) appearing anywhere in the <tt><i>powerName</i></tt>
	indicates that the next character in the name is to be displayed in
	upper-case.  Any plus-sign appearing in the <tt><i>ownWord</i></tt> will
	be displayed as a space.
	<p><a name=CLAIM></a>
	<u><b>Claiming New Home Centers</b></u><br>
	One or more <tt><i>center</i></tt> may be specified as <tt>&SC</tt> and
	each of these indicates that the power will be eligible to build in one
	owned non-home center; once having done so, that center will
	permanently become a home center for that power.  Note that such a
	"claimed" home center may even be a center that also serves as a home
	center for another power (whenever it is under that power's other control).
	<p><a name=FACTORIES></a>
	<u><b>Building in Non-Supply Centers</b></u><br>
	If the <tt><i>center</i></tt> is preceded (immediately, with no
	intervening space) by a plus-sign (<tt>+</tt>), the location is <u>not</u>
	a supply center, but the power <u>will</u> be eligible to build there.
	This type of location is referred to as a <i>factory</i> site.
	<P><a name=PARTISANS></a>
	<u><b>Conditional Building in Non-Supply Centers</b></u><br>
	If the <tt><i>center</i></tt> is preceded (immediately, with no
	intervening space) by an asterisk (<tt>*</tt>), the location
	is <u>not</u> a supply center, but the power <u>will</u> be eligible to
	build there
	<i>if and only if</i> the power owns at least one, but <u>not all</u>
	of his original home supply centers.
	This type of location is referred to as a <i>partisan</i> site.
	<P>
	If the <tt><i>center</i></tt> is preceded (immediately, with no
	intervening space) by a dash (<tt>-</tt>), the center is removed
	(if possible) from any pre-existing list of home centers for the power,
	and added to the list of unowned supply centers.
	This allows for locations to lose "home center" status.  Factory and
	partisan sites may also be removed in this same manner.
	<p>
	Multiple lines for a single <tt><i>powerName</i></tt> may be used to
	handle long lists of centers.<p>This type of line sets a "current power"
	such that all following lines (that specify initial owned centers and
	units) will apply to this power (as opposed to any other) until another
	<tt><i>powerName</i></tt> directive is encountered.

<p><dt><b><tt>UNOWNED [<i>center...</i>]</tt> -or-<br>
		<tt>NEUTRAL [<i>center...</i>]</tt> -or-<br>
		<tt>CENTERS [<i>center...</i>]</tt></b><dd>
	This line (all three forms are synonymous) is used to list all unowned
	supply centers.  The <tt>UNOWNED</tt>
	power differs from others in that all centers listed as <tt>UNOWNED</tt>
	<i>may</i> be listed elsewhere without error&nbsp;-- they are silently
	moved to
	owned status.  Additionally, any "current power" is forgotten by this line.
	Again, multiple lines may be used to supply a long list of
	unowned centers.  If you remove a center from the list of <tt>UNOWNED</tt>
	centers (using a dash before its name), that location is no longer
	a supply center at all.
	For example, to make Warsaw a non-supply
	center on the standard map, you would need to specify the two lines:
	"<tt>RUSSIA&nbsp;-WAR</tt>" and "<tt>UNOWNED&nbsp;-WAR</tt>"
	<i>in that order</i>.

<p><dt><b><tt>DUMMY</tt></b><dd>
	This indicates that the curent power is to be made a <tt>DUMMY</tt>
	power in the game.  No player will take the role of such a power.
	This power can be put into civil disorder using the <tt>CD_DUMMIES</tt>
	rule, or may be played under the <tt>CONTROL</tt> of another power
	(see the description of the <tt>ROTATE</tt> and <tt>CONTROL</tt>
	directives used in the game <a href=<URL>?page=Status>status file</a>).

<p><dt><b><tt>NEWHOMES <i>year...</i></tt></b><dd>
	This command will cause home supply centers to be completely reassigned to
	all players during the adjustment phase of the specified game-year(s).
	Each power's home SC's will be all of the centers he owns at the time.

<p><dt><b><tt>UNPLAYED <i>powerName...</i></tt></b><dd>
	This line removes the specified <tt><i>powerName</i></tt>, and all
	information that had been recorded for that power.  This directive
	is useful to create variants for a smaller number of players on a
	specific <tt>USE</tt>d map.

<a name=LEAGUE></a>
<p><dt><b><tt>LEAGUE <i>leagueName</i> </tt>-or-<tt><br>
			  LEAGUE <i>leagueName</i> STRICT </tt>-or-<tt><br>
			  LEAGUE <i>leagueName</i> BENIGN [<i>benignLeague</i>...]</tt></b>
			  <dd>
	This line assigns "league" affiliation and behavior to the current
	power.  If the line contains neither <tt>STRICT</tt> nor <tt>BENIGN</tt>,
	then the power is associated with the specified <i>leagueName</i> but
	is not restricted in any way by this association.  If the <i>leagueName</i>
	is followed by the word <tt>STRICT</tt>, the association with the
	league also restricts the power from being able to issue a convoy or
	support order to a unit owned by any power that is <u>not</u> associated
	with the same league.  If the <i>leagueName</i> is followed by the word
	<tt>BENIGN</tt>, the league association restricts the power from issuing
	any convoy or support order that aids a movement order by a unit owned by
	a power that is <u>not</u> associated with <u>any</u> <i>league</i> listed
	on the line, if (and only if) that movement order is being made into a
	space that is <u>currently occupied</u> by a unit owned by a power
	that <u>is</u> associated with one of the listed leagues.
	Note that league settings are ignored in any game with the
	<a href=PAGE:Rules#FICTIONAL_OK><tt>FICTIONAL_OK</tt></a> rule
	enabled (including all Crystal Ball Diplomacy variant games).

<p><dt><b><tt>VICTORY <i>centerCount...</i></tt></b><dd>
	Specifies a list of the supply center counts which will determine victory,
	from the first game-year forward (the final listed number is repeated for
	subsequent years).
	This line is optional; if omitted, the <tt>VICTORY</tt> criteria is
	set (for all game-years) to one supply center greater than half the
	number of centers on the map.

<A name=FLOW></a>
<p><dt><b><tt>FLOW [<i>season</i>:<i>phase</i>[,<i>phase</i>...] ...]</tt></b><dd>
	This line specifies the sequence of phases through a game year.
	Each season must be followed by a colon and then immediately (no
	intervening whitespace) by one or more phase types.  If more than
	one phase type is given, these should be separated from each other
	by commas (again, with no intervening whitespace).
	This line is optional;
	if not provided, the following is used:<br><tt>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;
	FLOW SPRING:MOVEMENT,RETREATS<br>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;
	FLOW FALL:MOVEMENT,RETREATS<br>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;
	FLOW WINTER:ADJUSTMENTS
	</tt><br>
	If no parameters are given with the FLOW directive, the whole flow is reset. 
	This can be useful if you're USEing a given map, and want to redefine its flow. 
	Note that if no other FLOW directive follows, the flow will revert to the default 
	given above.
	<br>
	Each individual phase type must begin with a unique letter.
	Additionally, the phase names <tt>MOVEMENT</tt>, <tt>RETREATS</tt>, and
	<tt>ADJUSTMENTS</tt> are reserved (and therefore, so are the initial
	letters <tt>M</tt>, <tt>R</tt>, and <tt>A</tt>).
	<P>
	The word <tt>NEWYEAR</tt> can be used as a <tt><i>season</i></tt>, and has
	a special meaning.  A flow may contain one or more <tt>NEWYEAR</tt>
	directives, which instruct the game when to modify the game-year.  A simple
	<tt>NEWYEAR</tt> will increment the year game-by one, and
	<tt>NEWYEAR:5</tt> (for example) will increment it by five.  Any flow that
	does <i>not</i> include a <tt>NEWYEAR</tt> directive will increase the
	game-year by one after the final phase in the <tt>FLOW</tt>.
	<P>
	The word <tt>IFYEARDIV</tt> can also be used as a <tt><i>season</i></tt>,
	and also has a special meaning.  This word will cause the game's next phase
	to be set to the first phase in the flow if the game-year is indivisible by
	a specified number.  For example, the flow descriptor <tt>IFYEARDIV:10</tt>
	means that the flow will continue normally only if the game-year is
	divisible by ten.  Otherwise, the initial listed element of the
	<tt>FLOW</tt> will be next.  The divisor may also include a modulus.
	For example, <tt>IFYEARDIV:2=1</tt> means that the flow will be reset
	(to its first listed element) if the game-year is even, and will continue
	normally if the game-year is odd.
	<P>
	When any phase that
	is not supported by the DPjudge code is current, all players will
	be shown the "waiting for processing" notice on their Webpages, and
	it will be up to the Master to advance the game to the next phase
	using the <tt>PROCESS</tt> command sent to the e-mail interface.
	(Deadlines will still be in force for these phases, however.)

<p><dt><b><tt>BEGIN <i>season year phaseType</i></tt></b><dd>
	Specifies the initial game phase.  This line is optional; if it is
	omitted, the initial game phase will be
	<tt>SPRING&nbsp;1901&nbsp;MOVEMENT</tt>.  Only the final <tt>BEGIN</tt>
	listed in the map file will be used.  This allows for map files
	to <tt>USE</tt> other map files and then override the start phase.

<p><dt><b><tt>OWNS <i>center...</i></tt></b><dd>
	Specifies the list of centers owned by the "current power"
	at the beginning of the game.  If not specified, the list of initially
	owned centers is set to the home centers that were listed for the
	"current power."  One or more of the <tt><i>center</i></tt>s may be
	<tt>SC!</tt>, which allows the player to place a build on any
	vacant home center (and become its owner) despite the fact that he does
	not own it at the start of the game.  Additionally, <tt>SC?</tt> may
	be used, to indicate an ability to build in any <i>unoccupied</i> home
	center and <i>not</i> take ownership of the center.

<p><dt><b><tt>CENTERS [<i>center...</i>]</tt></b><dd>
	Same as OWNS, but forgets about any previous OWNS lines.
	If no center is given, the power will start with no centers at all
	(if not followed by any new OWNS lines that is).

<p><dt><b><tt>HOME <i>center...</i></tt></b><dd>
	Sets the home centers for this power, overwriting any that are given
	on the power declaration line, including partisan and factory sites.

<p><dt><b><tt>HOMES [<i>center...</i>]</tt></b><dd>
	Same as HOME, but forgets about any previous HOME lines.
	If no center is given, the power will start with no build sites at all
	(if not followed by any new HOME lines that is).

<p><dt><b><tt>RESERVES [<i>count</i>]</tt></b><dd>
	A <tt>RESERVES</tt> line given for the "current power" indicates that the
	power is eligible to maintain <tt><i>count</i></tt> extra unit(s) (default
	is one), over and above the power's supply center count.  However, this
	is only true if the power owns at least one of its original home centers.
	Only the final-given <tt>RESERVES</tt> line will be used -- the
	<tt><i>count</i></tt>s for multiple <tt>RESERVES</tt> lines are <u>not</u>
	added.

<p><dt><b><tt>MILITIA [<i>count</i>]</tt></b><dd>
	Militia are similar to <tt>RESERVES</tt> (above), except that they are
	only granted if the additional force is used for home defense.
	For each <tt>MILITIA</tt>, the power
	is eligible to maintain one extra unit, over and above the power's supply
	center count <i>for each of his units that is positioned atop a home
	supply center when an adjustment phase arrives</i>.
	Only the final-given <tt>MILITIA</tt> line will be used -- the
	<tt><i>count</i></tt>s for multiple <tt>MILITIA</tt> lines are <u>not</u>
	added.

<p><dt><b><tt>UNITS</i></tt></b><dd>
	This line is optional.  If given, all units that have been listed
	as initial units for the "current power" are immediately forgotten.
	This can be used to alter the starting position of a power from
	that given in a <tt>USE</tt>d file.

<p><dt><b><tt><i>unit</i></tt></b><dd>
	Specifies a unit that the current power owns at the beginning of the game.
	The <tt><i>unit</i></tt> will replace any unit that may have previously
	been listed as beginning in that same space,

<p><dt><b><tt>IN <i>phase</i> <i>...</i></tt> -or-<br>
	<tt>IN <i>phaseAbbrev ...</i></tt></b><dd>
	Indicates that one or more map directives are to be applied to the map
	(modifying any current settings) during specific game phases.
	This can be used to cause spaces to change terrain (or become impassable,
	if the terrain is <tt>SHUT</tt>) in specific seasons.  The
	<tt>IN</tt> directive introduces directives to be run <i>only</i> in
	phases that match the given <tt><i>phase</i></tt>.  The
	<tt><i>phase</i></tt> may be either a <u>complete</u>
	<tt><i>phaseAbbrev</i></tt>iation (such as <tt>S1904M</tt>) or may
	be any initial part of a fully-written <tt><i>phase</i></tt> name
	(such as <tt>SPRING</tt> or <tt>SPRING&nbsp;1904</tt>).  For example,
	<tt>IN&nbsp;SPRING</tt> will introduce a directive or directives
	to be applied whenever
	the current game phase begins with <tt>SPRING</tt>.  If a single
	map directive is to be applied, it may be specified on the same line
	as the <tt>IN</tt>, separated from it by a colon.  For example:
	<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;IN SPRING: WATER ARC</tt>
	<br>Alternatively, multiple directives may be given, each on its own
	line, below the <tt>IN</tt>
	directive.  Note that in this case (where directives are given
	on subsequent lines of the file), <i>all</i> subsequent lines until the
	end of the file will apply
	to the most recent <tt>IN</tt> (or <tt>FROM</tt>, as described below).
	To return to giving directives that apply at all times, use the directive
	<tt>FROM&nbsp;START</tt>.

<p><dt><b><tt>FROM <i>movementPhaseAbbrev ...</i></tt> -or-<br>
	<tt>FROM START</tt></b><dd>
	The <tt>FROM</tt> directive is similar to the <tt>IN</tt> directive
	(discussed above)
	except that the directive or directives are applied once the indicated
	<tt><i>phaseAbbr</i></tt> has been reached, and remain in effect
	thereafter.  The same forms as allowed by the <tt>IN</tt> directive
	(that is, single- or multiple-line) are supported, but the
	<tt><i>movementPhaseAbbrev</i></tt>iation given must be a complete phase
	abbreviation (such as <tt>S1904M</tt>).  That is, it may <i>not</i> be a
	fully-written phase name or any initial part thereof (as can be given
	in an <tt>IN</tt> directive), and it may not indicate any phase type
	other than movement.  When using the multiple-line form of the directive,
	the directive <tt>FROM&nbsp;START</tt>
	can be used to return to giving directives that apply at all times.
	Note that when a <tt>.map</tt> file is loaded, all directives in
	<tt>FROM</tt> clauses, including any applying to the current phase,
	are processed (in the order in which the phases occurred), and
	<i>then</i> any <tt>IN</tt> clause(s) are processed for the current
	phase.

<p><dt><b><tt>[<i>variant</i>] DIRECTIVE[S]</tt> -and-<br>

<p><dt><b><tt>RULE <i>rule...</i></tt></b><dd>
	Specifies a DPjudge <a href=<URL>?page=Rules><tt>RULE</tt></a> that will be
	in effect for all games using this map.  For example,
	<tt>RULE&nbsp;BUILD_ANY</tt> would appear in a map file for the the
	<a href=<URL>?page=about:chaos>Chaos variant</a>, since that variant
	allows players to build new units in

	that the game may use.  Note that if any
