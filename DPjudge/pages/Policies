<li>
Every DPjudge shall have one human judgekeeper, who may request and
       receive the assistance of one or more other persons to fulfill the
       duties of this position.

<li>
The judgekeeper may not participate as a player in any game without
       express consent of the GameMaster.

<li>
The judgekeeper may set all use policies, may admit, blacklist, or remove any
person from the DPjudge Player Database, and may take any action he sees
       fit in or concerning any game run on the DPjudge.  Objections to the
       actions of the judgekeeper may be made only to the judgekeeper, who has
       sole right of review, and to the general public.

<li>
The judgekeeper is obligated to investigate all reported violations of
       these rules.  After due investigation into potential violations of
       these rules as reported to the judgekeeper by any player or GameMaster,
       or by the automated alarms provided by the DPjudge itself,
       sanctions for violations of these rules shall be decided by the
	   judgekeeper, whose decisions as to intention and severity of the
	   infraction are final.  No appeal except for reconsideration is
	   possible.  Penalties up to and including permanent and publicized
	   expulsion from the ranks of DPjudge users shall be enforced.

<li>
<b>Every game on the DPjudge must have a human GameMaster.</b>  The GameMaster
       is responsible for the creation of the game and the setting of all
       parameters.

<li><b><font color=red>The GameMaster may not participate as a power in the game.</font></b>  Further,
       the GameMaster may not take any action in the role of any player (such
       as entering orders, sending press, etc.) without having been instructed
       to do so by the player.

<li>A GameMaster may not abandon his responsibility to the game without
       having identified and installed a willing and dedicated replacement.
	   The judgekeeper is empowered to determine if a GameMaster is in
	   violation of this rule, based on attentiveness to the game and
	   resposiveness to the judgekeeper.  Violations of this rule will be
	   punished as severely as violations of any other rule.

<li>The GameMaster is the sole decider of game settings and parameters,
       including the determination as to whether the game is
	   <ul>
	   <li><b>a public game</b> (meaning that it is open to all DPjudge
	   users and <u>must be</u> played anonymously) or
       <li><b>a private game</b>
	   (meaning that it may include persons who know each other,
       and <u>need not</u> be played anonymously).</ul>
	   In games in which the chosen
	   settings do not automatically penalize tardy players by civil disorder
	   or automatic resignation, the GameMaster should make known to the players
	   his or her policy concerning the length of time he will wait after a
	   deadline before resigning a late player on his own accord or entertaining
	   calls from the other players to effect such a resignation.  Once
	   announced, this policy is not to be altered by the GameMaster during
	   the play of a game.

<li>Once any player has joined the game intending to participate, no
       parameters may be changed without the unanimous consent of all
       (uneliminated) players.  If a GameMaster alters any game setting or
       parameter without having obtained unanimous consent for the change,
       any objecting player may petition the judgekeeper, who shall restore
       the original parameters to the game and cause any necessary phases of
       play to be readjudicated.

<li>Notwithstanding the above rule, a GameMaster shall not modify any game
       setting or parameter that would alter the victory condition (including
       by the introduction of the NO_DIAS rule) of any game that has commenced
       play.  Any such change that is made is subject to revocation by the
       judgekeeper upon the request of any person.

<li>The GameMaster may not divulge to any player any information or
       misinformation concerning any other player's identity, game situation,
       strategy, tactical intentions or tendencies, alliance structure, or
       any other game-related information.

<li>The GameMaster may not kibitz by offering, even if requested, any
       strategic or tactical advice to any player or player(s) in the game,
       nor divulge any information to any person who is engaged in kibitzing.
       The GameMaster may, however, refer any player to published sources,
       including records of completed games, or to other human advisors who
       do not have access to game information.

<li>The GameMaster is responsible for enforcement of these rules in the
       game.  With the assistance of the players and automated alarms provided
       by the judge, the GameMaster is to be vigilant for any violations.
       The GameMaster may remove any player from the game by forceful
       resignation for any infraction of these rules that the GameMaster
       deems significant.  Upon due consideration of an incident, if the
       GameMaster determines that the violation is serious and intentional,
       it is to be reported immediately to the judgekeeper with a
       recommendation for further action.

<li>If all (uneliminated) players agree that the GameMaster should be
       replaced for any reason, then upon communication of this agreement to
       the judgekeeper, the judgekeeper shall assume responsibility to Master
       the game or to install another GameMaster of his choosing.

<li><b>A person may play one and only one power during any game.</b>  Exceptions:
       Players who have joined a game but who have not yet had a set of submitted
	   orders be processed by the judge are permitted to resign one power and
	   take up position as another power if they receive permission from the Game
	   Master, who is obliged in any game allowing private press to poll the
	   other players for unanimous consent.  This rule is also
	   waived for variant games in which control of multiple powers by a single
	   person is explicitly allowed by rule and for private games when unanimous
	   consent of the other players and the GameMaster is obtained for an
	   eliminated person to take a different, vacated role later in the game.

<li><b>No player shall at any time access any information on the DPjudge that
       cannot be retrieved using only his own power's password.</b> <!--

<li> -->
A player who becomes aware of any other player's password or the
       Master's password shall report this immediately to the GameMaster. <!-- ,
       and shall not in any way use that password in any interaction with
       the DPjudge. -->

<li><b><font color=red>No player shall join a public game if he has prior knowledge that any
       particular player known to him is participating in the game.</font></b>

<li>No player in a public game shall make any statement or divulge any
       information to any other player that will or may reveal his or her
       true identity, nor may a player represent himself or herself to be
       some other real-life person.  If a player becomes aware of the true
       identity of any player in the game after play has commenced, he is
       to immediately report this knowledge to the GameMaster and inform the
       GameMaster of any and all relationships that he may have with the
       player whose identity has been exposed.  Likewise, any player who
       becomes aware that he has accidentally exposed his own identity to
       another player is to report this immediately to the GameMaster.  The
       decision of the GameMaster as to any necessary remedy, including
       announcing the interplayer relationship to the other players and/or
       removing one or more players from the game, is final.  Note that
       players who believe they recognize the writing style or other
       peculiarities of a player are not obliged to report their presumption
       as to the identity of the other player.

<li><b>All players must be completely honest and candid in all communications
       with the GameMaster and the judgekeeper.  All violations of this rule
       shall be penalized by blacklisting, and no exceptions shall be made.</b>

<li>All players are obliged to abide by the spirit and intent of all game
       settings and parameters.  Except when forbidden by rule, communication
       between players may be made at any time, and eliminated players may
       continue to communicate and participate in a game.  Except in private
       games, all interplayer communication, including draw and concession
       proposals, is to take place using only the press mechanisms provided
       by the judge.

<li>Interception by any means of any e-mail or Web traffic properly
       addressed and delivered to another party is forbidden.  This rule
       covers reading any other player's e-mail without his or her knowledge
       by gaining access to their e-mail client or logged-in Web browser,
       and also covers interception by means of network packet
       redirection and other electronic means.

<li>Cross-gaming transactions (for example, rewards or retaliation in one
       game for actions in another game) and extra-gaming transactions (such
       as paying real-world money for an alliance) are prohibited.

<li>Players who require a deadline extension should contact the GameMaster
       as far in advance as possible, and inform the GameMaster of the reason
	   for the request.  Repeated absenteeism or tardiness in submitting orders
	   may result in the removal of a player from the game at the sole
	   discretion of the GameMaster.

<li>Mild literary abuse of the GameMaster and of other players is permitted,
       but use of profane or obscene language will not be tolerated if any
       objection is raised from any quarter.  If the GameMaster feels that
       any disagreement has turned personal and that the discussion surrounding
       it has gone too far, the GameMaster will issue a warning, after which
       the conduct in question must stop or this rule shall be deemed to have
       been violated.  <b>In the worst case this may lead to blacklisting.</b>

<li>A player who discovers that the judge has made an error in adjudication
       must inform the GameMaster and judgekeeper immediately.  If the
       GameMaster determines that it is not possible to correct the error
       without affecting the result of the game, the GameMaster may terminate
       the game.

<li>Any player who becomes aware that any other player or GameMaster is
       acting in violation of these rules, intentionally or otherwise, has a
       positive obligation to immediately inform the GameMaster (or, in the
       case of perceived violation by the GameMaster, the judgekeeper).
