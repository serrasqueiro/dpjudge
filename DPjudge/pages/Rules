<!-- RULE ALWAYS_CONFIRM -->
	Always send a confirmation message after each order update, and copy the

	Useful for investigating or discouraging claims of corrupted order entry,
	e.g. when a password became exposed.
<!-- RULE END -->

<a name=FICTIONAL_OK></a><p><dt><b><tt>FICTIONAL_OK</tt></b><dd>
<!-- RULE FICTIONAL_OK -->
    Players may submit orders to and involving units that do not exist.
	This could be because the game is <tt>BLIND</tt> or (as in the Crystal
	Ball variant)
	because the unit <i>may</i> exist by the time the order is processed.
	If this rule is used, the <i>type</i> (army or fleet) of each unit being
	ordered <b><i><u>must</u></i></b> be specified by the player.
	Players are not told if their orders mention
	units that do not exist.
	<p>Note that this rule obviates any and all
	<a href=<PAGE>Map#LEAGUE><tt>LEAGUE</tt></a> settings for a game.
	That is, orders are not checked to ensure they are compatible with
	any restrictions placed by the league membership of the owning power.
<!-- RULE END -->

<a name=SHOW_PHANTOM></a><p><dt><b><tt>SHOW_PHANTOM</tt></b><dd>
<!-- RULE SHOW_PHANTOM !NO_CHECK -->
	Supports and convoys offered to non-existent units are announced
	[note that <tt>SHOW_PHANTOM</tt> implies
	<a href=#FICTIONAL_OK>the <tt>FICTIONAL_OK</tt> rule</a>, above].
	Without <tt>SHOW_PHANTOM</tt>, all such orders are displayed as
	<tt>HOLD</tt> orders.  Additionally, <tt>SHOW_PHANTOM</tt>
	modifies the results in that it suppresses (for all orders, not simply
	those referencing non-existent units) the display of the
	the nationality of a supported or convoyed unit.
	For example, an Italian support for a German unit would usually
	be displayed as:<br>
	<tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Italy: Army Rome SUPPORT German Army Venice.</tt><br>
	If the <tt>SHOW_PHANTOM</tt> rule is in force, the same order
	would be announced without the word "<tt>German</tt>".
<!-- RULE END -->

<a name=ORDER_ANY></a><p><dt><b><tt>ORDER_ANY</tt></b><dd>
<!-- RULE ORDER_ANY -->
    Players may issue orders to units owned by any player, not just those
    they themselves own.  This could be because proxy orders are allowed,
    or (as in Payola) because all units are subject to acting according to
    the highest financial bid received.
<!-- RULE END -->

<a name=PROXY_OK></a><p><dt><b><tt>PROXY_OK</tt></b><dd>
<!-- RULE PROXY_OK -NO_PROXY -->
    Players may issue the proxy order to any one or more of their units.
    [If this rule is used, <tt>ORDER_ANY</tt> is effectively in use as well.]
	Only the actual original owner of a unit may issue it a proxy order;
	that is, units may not be "re-proxied" from one power to
	another.  Note also that if a unit receives a proxy order,
	but then, later in the power's list of orders (if the variant allows this),
	an order is given to the unit, the unit will follow that order.  Units
	that are proxied to a power that does not issue an order to that unit
	will <tt>HOLD</tt> and will be eligible to receive support in place.
<!-- RULE END -->

<a name=NO_PROXY></a><p><dt><b><tt>NO_PROXY</tt></b><dd>
<!-- RULE NO_PROXY -PROXY_OK -->
	Players may <i>not</i> issue the proxy order.  This rule is in force by
	default -- it need not be explicitly listed.  However, if it <i>is</i>
	explicitly listed, any <tt>PROXY_OK</tt> rule is silently countermanded.
<!-- RULE END -->

<a name=COASTAL_CRAWL></a><p><dt><b><tt>COASTAL_CRAWL</tt></b><dd>
<!-- RULE COASTAL_CRAWL -->
	A fleet in a province having multiple coasts may swap places with a fleet
	moving to a different coast of that province.  For example,
	<tt>F Spa/sc-Por</tt> and <tt>F&nbsp;Por-Spa/nc</tt> would not bounce
	each other.
<!-- RULE END -->

<a name=FRIENDLY_FIRE></a><p><dt><b><tt>FRIENDLY_FIRE</tt></b><dd>
<!-- RULE FRIENDLY_FIRE -->
	In games using this rule, the rules concerning self-dislodgement and
	cutting one's own support are modified.  Players may dislodge their
	own units, and support given by a unit for an attack against a unit
	owned by the same power will be valid and will be counted towards causing
	a dislodgement.  Additionally, even an unsuccessful attack made by a unit
	against another unit owned by the same power will cut any support 
	being offered by the attacked unit.
<!-- RULE END -->

<a name=WEAK_BOUNCES></a><p><dt><b><tt>WEAK_BOUNCES</tt></b><dd>
<!-- RULE WEAK_BOUNCES -->
	This rule implements "Key's Rule" (named for its developer, Jeff Key,
	who also created the Italian <a href=<POUCH>/Online/Openings>Key
	Lepanto</a> opening).  Key's rule says that a unit that is ordered to
	move will have absolutely no defensive strength to hold its original
	position if its move fails.  Thus, if <tt>A Vie-Gal</tt> fails,
	a foreign unit that was ordered <tt>A Bud-Vie</tt> will dislodge
	<tt>Vie</tt> even if it attacks without support.  A unit will only
	successfully "bounce" back to a space if no foreign attack (or, if the
	<tt>FRIENDLY_FIRE</tt> rule is also in force, any attack at all) was made
	on the space, or if the space is a beleaguered garrison.

<!-- RULE DEFAULT_UNORDERED -->
	Movement phase orders are not checked to ensure that a player has provided

<!-- RULE UNITS_ADAPT -->
	Some variants use maps on which the terrain of some or all of the spaces
	can change during the game.  Fleets on water spaces that become multi-coast
	provinces (or whose multiple coasts change) will be landed at the coast
	whose terrain type (including <tt>AMEND</tt>) was specified <i>last</i>
	in the game's <tt>.map</tt> file directives. Fleets located on a coast
	of a multi-coast
	province which becomes a single-coast province will remain in the province.
	Without the <tt>UNITS_ADAPT</tt> rule, units located on spaces that change
	terrain type to a terrain incompatible with the unit will be destroyed.
	However, if the <tt>UNITS_ADAPT</tt> rule is used, then units will survive
	terrain changes by converting, if necessary, to the appropriate type of
	unit.  For example, if a fleet is located in the Black Sea, and the Black
	Sea becomes a landlocked space, the fleet will become an army.
	The <tt>HIBERNATE</tt> rule (below) also affects unit behavior if
	terrain changes occur; if both rules are used, units will
	<tt>HIBERNATE</tt> if possible, but armies finding themselves on water
	will <tt>ADAPT</tt> and become fleets.

	may only be ordered to <tt>HOLD</tt> until the space is no longer
	impassable.
	Note that the <tt>HIBERNATE</tt> rule has precedence over the
	<tt>UNITS_ADAPT</tt> rule, meaning that if both rules are used, units

	Note that a fleet that is portaged through an army that is

	It's perfectly valid to convoy a fleet from one coast to another coast
	of the same province using an army stationed in any adjacent province.
	Just as with orders that <i>support</i> fleets moving to

<!-- RULE NO_RETURN -->
    This rule forbids a unit being convoyed from returning to its origin
    or traveling a path that includes a convoying unit more than once.
    For example, on the standard map, an army in Greece may be ordered to
    convoy to Naples along a path that travels through the Ionian Sea more
    than once: <tt>A GRE-ION-ADR-ION-NAP</tt>.  This rule forbids such an order.
    <P>
    Use of this rule also invalidates orders given to convoyer units offering
    to be involved in convoys that would require that any convoyer be used
    more than once.  For example, on the standard map,
    <tt>F ADR C A GRE-NAP</tt> would be invalidated, due to
    the fact that such a convoy would necessarily (provided that the
    <a href="#COASTAL_CONVOY"><tt>COASTAL_CONVOY</tt></a> rule is not in
    effect) travel through <tt>F ION</tt> twice.
    <P>
    <i>[Historical note: this rule originally was <tt>CONVOY_BACK</tt>, and
    was used to <u>allow</u> return-pathing in convoy orders.  That rule was
    created as an optional rule because of (and was not permitted in) DPjudge
    games that were simply Web front-ends for games being run on Ken Lowe
    judges, for the reason that the Ken Lowe judge had a 255-character line
    limit on orders.  When the DPjudge dropped the ability to be used to
    front-end Ken Lowe judge games, this rule took its current form.]</i>

	was an <i>original</i> home center for any of the powers in the game.
	Note that a power may capture and build in a home center of another
	power even if that other power has never owned that home center.
	This could be the case in games that use e.g. the
	<a href=#MOBILIZE>MOBILIZE</a> rule or where the starting positions
	are shifted. In games where home centers get reassigned, such as on
	maps that have a <a href=<PAGE>Map#NEWHOMES>NEWHOMES</a> directive,
	the <i>original</i> home centers are not necessarily the ones the power had
	at the start of the game, but rather those from the last reassignment
	prior to the current phase.

<!-- RULE END -->

<a name=GARRISON></a><p><dt><b><tt>GARRISON</tt></b><dd>
<!-- RULE GARRISON -->
	Games that use the <tt>GARRISON</tt> rule require that at least one home
	center of each eliminated power be occupied at the beginning of every

	The consequence of not doing so is that the eliminated player -- even
	if that player still has units on the board at the time -- becomes
	eligible (as long as he has not <tt>RESIGN</tt>ed) to build a unit in any
	one of his home centers, and the power or powers that own these home centers
	become ineligible to build there (in games using <tt>BUILD_ANY</tt> or
	<tt>HOME_BUILDS</tt>, where this would otherwise be possible).
	The eliminated player does <i>not</i> (yet)
	regain ownership of the center on which he builds, but he <i>is</i>
	immediately no longer considered eliminated, and participates in any draw
	and concession votes.  Note that if the eliminated power builds a unit,
	does not use it to gain a supply center in the following game-year, and
	if the same situation exists at the end of that game-year, the power will
	be eligible to build yet again, giving that power two units without benefit
	of owning a supply center, and so on.

    In a <tt>BLIND</tt> game, each player receives individually tailored
	movement, retreat, and adjustment phase
	results and sees a map made from these tailored results.  Each player's
	personalized results will contain only:
	<ul>
	<li>his own units and their orders,
	<li>the units (and possibly the orders of those units) owned by other
		powers, provided that the unit started or ended the turn adjacent to
		a space where one of the player's own units either began or
		ended the turn,
	<li>the units (and possibly the orders of those units) owned by other
		powers, provided that the unit started or ended the turn in or adjacent
		to a home supply center of the player in question (regardless
		of whether or not that center is currently owned by the player, and
		&mdash; as in the case of games using the <tt>MOBILIZE</tt> rule &mdash;
		even if the center has never been owned by the player).
	<li>his own list of owned supply centers,
	<li>the ownership of any foreign-owned supply centers within his
		"viewing range" as described above; all other centers will appear
		(on the graphical map) to be unowned,
	<li>his own unit-count, center-count, and adjustment phase status
		(number of builds or removes he is eligible or required to submit).
	</ul>
	When a foreign unit is "visible" to a player, the player will either
	receive full information on the unit's order (if he could "see" the 
	unit both before <i>and</i> after the moves), or will receive one of
	the following instead (based on whether the unit was visible to the
	player before the moves or after the moves, but not both):<br>
	<tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Army XXX ARRIVES.<br>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Army XXX DEPARTS.<br>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Army YYY LOST.<br>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Army YYY FOUND.</tt><br>
	Observers and all other non-map powers receive basically no information
	from the judge, other than the notice that the game has progressed to
	the next phase.  Notice that this does <i>not</i> apply to any player or 
	observer who is specified to be <tt>OMNISCIENT</tt>.  Such a person
	receives the same results as the Master <i>and</i> as each of the
	players (during the period of time that the person is <tt>OMNISCIENT</tt>).
	Omniscient persons can also still log in at the Website as any or all of
	the map powers to see the information at each player's disposal.
	The <tt>BLIND</tt> rule also has the following effects:
	<ul>
	<li>It is never disclosed in the results if a unit's order was
	void -- the <tt>(*void*)</tt> annotation is completely suppressed from
	appearing in the results.  However, convoyed armies that were issued
	orders that would have been <tt>(*void*)</tt> are <i>re-</i>annotated
	in the results with the <tt>(*no&nbsp;convoy*)</tt> annotation.</li>
	<li>The <tt>FICTIONAL_OK</tt> rule is in effect.</li>
	<li>The <tt>HIDE_ABSENTEES</tt> rule is in effect.</li>
	<li>The <tt>HIDE_DUMMIES</tt> rule is in effect, unless explicitly disabled.</li>
	<li>The <tt>HIDE_LATE_POWERS</tt> rule is in effect.</li>
	<li>The <tt>SHOW_PHANTOM</tt> rule is in effect.</li>
	<li>The <tt>SILENT_ABSENCES</tt> rule is in effect.</li>
	<li>The <tt>NO_DIAS</tt> rule is disallowed.</li>
	</ul>
	Note that visibility is determined by the <i>space</i>, not the coast,
	on which a unit is located.  A unit is visible to, and can "see," any
	unit that can support it, or that it can support.  For example, a fleet
	in the Western Mediterranean <i><u>can</u></i> "see" a fleet on the
	<i>north</i> coast of Spain, <i>and vice-versa</i>!
	Note also that the <tt>BLIND</tt> rule may have some further effects if used
	in different rule variants (such as Payola&nbsp;&#8212;
	<a href=#TINCUP>see below</a>).

<p><HR><br><dt><b>1.8 Power Control</b>
<!-- RULE GROUP 8 Power Control -->
<dl>
Control over a dummy power, as is the case in Missing Man variants, is usually
established by adding a <a href="<PAGE>Status#CONTROL"><tt>CONTROL</tt></a>
line to the controlled power data before the start of the game. Below is
described a mechanism to gain (and lose) control of a dummy power <i>during</i>
the course of the game.
<a name=VASSAL_DUMMIES></a><p><dt><b><tt>VASSAL_DUMMIES</tt></b><dd>
<!-- RULE VASSAL_DUMMIES +CD_DUMMIES +CD_BUILDS +TEAM_VICTORY -->
	With this rule in use, all <tt>DUMMY</tt> powers are eligible to become
	vassals of the other powers.  This means that the <tt>DUMMY</tt> power will
	never lose ownership of its home center(s).  That is, even though the home
	center(s) of a <tt>DUMMY</tt> power might be occupied by another power at
	the beginning of an adjustment phase, it remains owned by the <tt>DUMMY</tt>
	power.  Instead of losing its home center(s) to an occupying power,
	the <tt>DUMMY</tt> power becomes a controlled "vassal state" of that power
	if every one of its home centers is occupied by forces controlled by the
	same foreign power.  Powers receive <tt>CONTROL</tt> of their vassal states
	(and are thus able to log in and issue orders for them).  This control
	continues unless and until the home center(s) of the vassal are (all) 
	occupied by forces controlled by some other power at the beginning of an
	adjustment phase.
	<p>
	Victory condition is calculated based on the total number of centers owned
	by a power and all of its vassals.  This is accomplished by the automatic
	inclusion of the <a href=#TEAM_VICTORY>TEAM_VICTORY</a> rule.  Vassal states
	cannot own the supply centers of their own controlling powers, meaning that
	before adjustments, all home centers of a Great Power that are owned
	and/or occupied by units of one of its own vassals immediately revert to
	ownership of the controlling Great Power.
	<p>
	Before an autonomous state has been made a vassal, any units that it owns
	will behave according to <tt>CD_BUILDS</tt> and whatever other rules are in
	place governing <tt>DUMMY</tt> powers.  Such uncontrolled autonomous
	powers are able (in games in which such uncontrolled units can move)
	to gain supply centers by occupying home centers of the Great Powers or
	neutral centers, but can never take possession of the home center of
	another <tt>DUMMY</tt> power, nor can an autonomous or vassal state become
	a vassal of another.
	<p>
	If a power that controls one or more vassals
	loses ownership of all of its own centers, that player may continue in
	the game, still controlling the vassals owned by his (otherwise eliminated)
	power, and remains eligible to win the game if the victory condition is met.
	<p>
	Note also that the <tt>VASSAL_DUMMIES</tt> rule may have some further
	effects if used in different rule variants (such as Payola&nbsp;&#8212;
	<a href=#VASSAL_TRANSFERS>see below</a>).
<!-- RULE END -->

<a name=TORN_ALLEGIANCE></a><p><dt><b><tt>TORN_ALLEGIANCE</tt></b><dd>
<!-- RULE TORN_ALLEGIANCE +VASSAL_DUMMIES -->
	This rule dictates that any vassal unit that is standing on an SC that does
	not belong to his controlling power or one of that power's vassals after
	the new vassal status has been determined (usually at the end of Fall
	Retreats), is automatically destroyed.

	the last player submits orders (this player will have no opportunity
	to modify them).  Additionally, players will not be allowed to direct
	that the game wait for any deadline before processing.  This rule is

<!-- RULE END -->

<a name=NO_MINOR_WAIT></a><p><dt><b><tt>NO_MINOR_WAIT</tt></b><dd>

<!-- RULE END -->

<a name=SILENT_ABSENCES></a><p><dt><b><tt>SILENT_ABSENCES</tt></b><dd>

	This rule suppresses the absence broadcasts (informing that a

	introducing a period of time during which no deadlines will
	be set).  Only the Master will receive notice
	of the planned absence.  (The period of time covered by the absence

<!-- RULE END -->

<a name=HIDE_ABSENTEES></a><p><dt><b><tt>HIDE_ABSENTEES</tt></b><dd>

<!-- RULE END -->

<a name=NO_ABSENCES></a><p><dt><b><tt>NO_ABSENCES</tt></b><dd>

	If this rule is used, then when any game-phase is ready to be processed,

	the adjudication and perform any other activity prior to releasing the

	In games <i><u><b>not</b></u></i> using this rule,
	draw and concession votes are never called for.  Instead, each player

	This rule emulates face-to-face play, in which players could (by
	accident or design) issue invalid orders to their units.  This rule
	is also useful in <tt>NO_PRESS</tt> games to allow for limited
	player communication.
	When they are entered, movement phase orders are only very minimally
	checked for validity.  The <i>only</i> checks that are made at
	the time an order is entered are:
	<ol>
	<li>Every component of the order must be understood.  That is, the
		order must appear to be a Diplomacy move, convoy, support or
		hold order, and all placenames must be identifiable on the map
		in use. This check catches
		inadvertant misspellings, such as "<tt>URK</tt>" for "<tt>UKR</tt>".
		In fact, this is known as the "Urk check."
	<li>Any placename abbreviation that
		is potentially ambiguous is declared
		erroneous and must be changed.  For example, the order
		"<tt>TYR H</tt>" is rejected because it may be an order for
		an army in Tyrolia to hold, or for a fleet in the Tyrrhenian
		Sea to hold.
	<li>A support for a fleet move may not specify the destination coast of
		the fleet.  This error must also be corrected.
	</ol>
	<p>
	Therefore, most errors <i>(including the omission of the fleet-path of
	a convoying army from its order!)</i> are not detected until the phase
	is ready to process, at which time the erroneous orders will be ignored.
	All units that had been given erroneous or multiple orders will
	<tt>HOLD</tt> (and may receive support), and all erroneous orders will
	be reported in the results, flagged as <tt>(*invalid*)</tt>.

<!-- RULE CD_SUPPORTS =CIVIL_DISORDER -->
	This rule causes powers that are in civil disorder in movement phases to
	issue "sensible support" orders rather than <tt>HOLD</tt> orders.
	The power's units will receive orders to support each other,
	<!--
	with preference to supporting units located on supply center, and only
	-->
	giving support where possible to units that are in danger of
	foreign attack having the strength to dislodge.
	Note that if neither the <tt>CIVIL_DISORDER</tt>
	nor the <tt>CD_DUMMIES</tt> rules are specified,
	all powers (whether dummy or not) will have their movement phase
	orders default at the deadline as described
	if they have not been submitted.

	<p>The <tt>DEFAULT_UNORDERED</tt> rule has no effect except on actual

	Additionally, any rules that are specific to any other variant

<!-- RULE GROUP V3 Payola Income -->
<dl>
<a name=EXCHANGE></a><p><dt><b><tt>EXCHANGE</tt></b><dd>
<!-- RULE EXCHANGE -->
	This rule implements Bruce Duewer's "Exchange Payola" variant, in which
	the human players take on the roles of investors rather than the powers
	on the board, and compete for capital in a fluctuating market of stock
	futures in each of the powers.  Players "float" the various powers like
	publicly traded companies, and can become the CEO by stockholder vote.
	Stock may be issued by (and purchased from) the powers and traded
	between players during specific phases of the game.
<!-- RULE END -->

<a name=FLAT_TAX></a><p><dt><b><tt>FLAT_TAX</tt></b><dd>
<!-- RULE FLAT_TAX -->
    Income at year-end is defined to be a specific number of AgP for
    each center (rather than the figure arrived at using the diminishing
	returns scheme).  The amount of AgP given per center is equal to the
	number of players originally
    in the game.

<!-- RULE END -->

<a name=ZEROSUM></a><p><dt><b><tt>ZEROSUM</tt></b><dd>
<!-- RULE ZEROSUM -->
    There is no tax income.  Players begin the game with 10 AgP for each
	of their home centers, and as each center changes hands, money moves
    from one player's treasury to another.  Capture of a neutral SC pays
	10 AgP to the new owner, and all pre-owned SC's, when changing hands,
    cause a strict proportion of the former owner's treasury to be paid
    to the new owner.

    The <i>owner</i> of each successfully bribed unit, but <i>not</i>
	its exact order, is revealed to the bribing party.  To learn its
	exact order, the player must match the accepted price uniquely to his
	offer sheet.  Additionally, orders that are impossible (such as to
	support a non-existent unit) are allowed [the <tt>SHOW_PHANTOM</tt>
	rule], but will be silently ignored at
	processing time.  This rule is incompatible with the <tt>ZERO_FOREIGN</tt>

	<i>Blind Payola is known as "Tin Cup" Diplomacy.</i>

<a name=EBAYOLA></a><p><dt><b><tt>EBAYOLA</tt></b><dd>
<!-- RULE EBAYOLA -->
	This variation comes from the mind of Payola creator John Woolley.
	In eBayola, the total cost of a successful bribe is automatically
	reduced to one silver piece more than the highest <i>non-</i>winning
	bribe.  Any resulting cost savings for the contributor(s) to the
	winning bribe are awarded to the powers according to their position in
	the acceptance list of the bribed unit (then, if necessary, randomly
	to any contributing observers).
<!-- RULE END -->

<!-- RULE END -->

<a name=HIDE_OFFERS></a><p><dt><b><tt>HIDE_OFFERS</tt></b><dd>
<!-- RULE HIDE_OFFERS -NO_LEDGERS -->
	In the notices sent after each movement phase, players are <u>not</u>
	provided a copy of their submitted offer sheet or the details
	concerning which of these offers were accepted and which were not.
	The notice provides each player only with the orders that his own
	units will issue, the total amount paid to each of his own units,
	and the player's new, adjusted balance.  This rule is useful when playing
	Payola face-to-face and issuing printouts of the turn notices to
	the players, since the players will not be able to reliably
	disclose the full details of their offers.
<!-- RULE END -->

<a name=PUBLIC_TOTALS></a><p><dt><b><tt>PUBLIC_TOTALS</tt></b><dd>
<!-- RULE PUBLIC_TOTALS !BLIND -->
    The total bribe amount paid to each unit is made available to all

<a name=PAY_DUMMIES></a><p><dt><b><tt>PAY_DUMMIES</tt></b><dd>

	Bribes may only be offered to units that are owned by <tt>DUMMY</tt>

	ordering them as in normal, non-Payola games, but all unowned powers
	will operate in Payola mode. 
	[This rule automatically includes the <tt>CD_DUMMIES</tt> rule.]
	Note that (even in games that do not use the <tt>PAY_DUMMIES</tt> rule)
	acceptance lists for <tt>DUMMY</tt> powers are not used.
	Instead, all ties for control of a <tt>DUMMY</tt> unit and that involve

	set of powers are decided by <tt>HOLD</tt>ing the contested unit and

<!-- RULE END -->

<a name=LIMIT_OFFERS></a><p><dt><b><tt>LIMIT_OFFERS</tt></b><dd>

<a name=REMOTE_BRIBE></a><p><dt><b><tt>REMOTE_BRIBE</tt></b><dd>

	Bribes may only be offered to the player's own units and to any

	either of the two units to support the other to hold.
	Note that if the <tt>CD_DUMMIES</tt> rule is also used, this restriction
	is disregarded in bribes issues to any <tt>DUMMY</tt> power.  That is,

<!-- RULE TOUCH_BRIBE -REMOTE_BRIBE !PAY_DUMMIES -->
	Bribes may only be offered to the player's own units and to any
	foreign units that are adjacent to one of the player's own units.
	Adjacency is determined by the ability of either of the two units
	to support the other to hold.  Note that because only certain powers
	may issue bribes to each unit, there is a stronger chance that a
	player will know which foreign power purchased hostile control of
	his unit on a turn.
	Note that if the <tt>CD_DUMMIES</tt> rule is also used, this restriction
	is disregarded in bribes issues to any <tt>DUMMY</tt> power.  That is,

	without regard to adjacency.

<a name=ZERO_FOREIGN></a><p><dt><b><tt>ZERO_FOREIGN</tt></b><dd>
